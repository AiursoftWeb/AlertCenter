AlertCenter is a sample project.

Default user name is `admin@default.com` and default password is `Admin@123456!`.

## Severity-based notification channels

In **接入应用 → 推送设置**, select channels independently for each severity:
`sev1` (严重), `sev2` (错误), `sev3` (警告), and `sev4` (信息).
Each level can target multiple channels. Leaving a level unselected still saves its alerts but creates no notification deliveries.
Matching is exact; selecting `sev2` does not implicitly include `sev1`.

Disabled channels retain their selections but do not receive new deliveries.
Changes apply only to new alerts, not historical messages or existing delivery tasks.
SQLite and MySQL migrations preserve existing bindings by enabling all four levels.
No SDK changes are required: clients continue reporting the alert's `level`.

## Inbox search

**站内通知** opens with unread notifications by default. Use the visible **仅看未读 / 全部通知 / 仅看已读**
links above the search form to switch scope, retaining other filters and returning to page one.
Combine title/body keyword search,
read status (unread/read/all), source application, severity, notification channel, and inclusive
UTC receipt-date filters. Filtering happens in the database before the 20-item pagination.
Application and channel choices come from your own notification history; test notifications
have no source application or severity. Search covers the full title/body, not only the preview.

Pagination, refresh, and read actions preserve the filters; submitting a new search starts at page one.
**我的全部通知标为已读** always marks all of your unread notifications, including those outside
the current filters and page, without changing another user's read state.

## Try

Try a running AlertCenter [here](https://alertCenter.aiursoft.com).

## Run in Ubuntu

The following script will install\update this app on your Ubuntu server. Supports Ubuntu 25.04.

On your Ubuntu server, run the following command:

```bash
curl -sL https://github.com/aiursoftweb/alertCenter/raw/master/install.sh | sudo bash
```

Of course it is suggested that append a custom port number to the command:

```bash
curl -sL https://github.com/aiursoftweb/alertCenter/raw/master/install.sh | sudo bash -s 8080
```

It will install the app as a systemd service, and start it automatically. Binary files will be located at `/opt/apps`. Service files will be located at `/etc/systemd/system`.

### apt package filesystem layout

When installed via `apt install aiursoft-alertCenter`, the following paths are created:

| Role | Path | `apt remove` | `apt purge` |
|------|------|:---:|:---:|
| Working directory & binaries | `/usr/share/aiursoft-alertCenter/` | ✓ | ✓ |
| Config file | `/etc/aiursoft-alertCenter/appsettings.json` | | ✓ |
| Runtime data (DB, storage, keys) | `/var/lib/aiursoft-alertCenter/` | | |
| systemd unit | `/lib/systemd/system/aiursoft-alertCenter.service` | ✓ | ✓ |

The config file is a dpkg conffile — kept on `remove`, deleted only on `purge`.
Runtime data under `/var/lib/aiursoft-alertCenter/` is user data and intentionally never removed by dpkg.

## Run manually

Requirements about how to run

1. Install [.NET 10 SDK](http://dot.net/) and [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/).
2. Execute `npm install` at `wwwroot` folder to install the dependencies.
3. Execute `dotnet run` to run the app.
4. Use your browser to view [http://localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000).

## Run in Microsoft Visual Studio

1. Open the `.sln` file in the project path.
2. Press `F5` to run the app.

## Run in Docker

First, install Docker [here](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/).

Then run the following commands in a Linux shell:

```bash
image=aiursoft/alertCenter
appName=alertCenter
sudo docker pull $image
sudo docker run -d --name $appName --restart unless-stopped -p 5000:5000 -v /var/www/$appName:/data $image
```

That will start a web server at `http://localhost:5000` and you can test the app.

The docker image has the following context:

| Properties  | Value                           |
|-------------|---------------------------------|
| Image       | aiursoft/alertCenter               |
| Ports       | 5000                            |
| Binary path | /app                            |
| Data path   | /data                           |
| Config path | /data/appsettings.json          |

## How to contribute

There are many ways to contribute to the project: logging bugs, submitting pull requests, reporting issues, and creating suggestions.

Even if you with push rights on the repository, you should create a personal fork and create feature branches there when you need them. This keeps the main repository clean and your workflow cruft out of sight.

We're also interested in your feedback on the future of this project. You can submit a suggestion or feature request through the issue tracker. To make this process more effective, we're asking that these include more information to help define them more clearly.

## Configuration Guide

The defaults run as a standalone application with SQLite, local accounts, local file storage, and no ClickHouse server. Change a setting only after preparing the dependency named in its comment.

The Docker image copies this file to `/data/appsettings.json` on its first start and keeps that copy on later starts. Mount `/data` as a persistent volume. To override a value without editing the file, use an environment variable with double underscores, such as `Storage__Path` or `AppSettings__OIDC__ClientSecret`.

```jsonc
{
  "ConnectionStrings": {
    // True: cache EF Core query results in this process. False: read from the database on every query.
    "AllowCache": "True",

    // Sqlite: use a local database file and no database server. MySql: use an external MySQL server.
    // When changing this value, also replace DefaultConnection with a connection string for that provider.
    "DbType": "Sqlite",
    // With Sqlite, this creates app.db in the process working directory and applies migrations at startup.
    "DefaultConnection": "DataSource=app.db;Cache=Shared"

    // MySql requires a reachable server, database, user, and password. The application applies migrations at startup.
